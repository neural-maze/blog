The other day I was playing around with one of the hottest frameworks right now: [**CrewAI**](https://www.crewai.com/).

As defined in the documentation:

> "Cutting-edge framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents.
By fostering collaborative intelligence, CrewAI empowers agents to work together
seamlessly, tackling complex tasks"

So, as you can imagine, CrewAI is the right tool if you want to deal with ["multi-agentic patterns"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sal78ACtGTc&ab_channel=SequoiaCapital) (
drawing inspiration from Andrew Ng's video on agentic patterns).

One **(huge)** advantage of CrewAI over other multi-agent frameworks (e.g. Autogen, ChatDev) is its simplicity.
To start creating your own crews, you just need to understand three key concepts, namely [Agent](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Agents/),
[Task](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Tasks/) and [Tool](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Tools/).

To make it easier for you, I have created the following simplified diagram üëá

![Alt text][image-2]

So, as you can see, our "crew" is made of three different agents (represented by the
cute robots ü§ñ) which are assigned to a specific task. To achieve each of the tasks goals,
the agents may (although they may not) need to use some specific tools (e.g. a web scrapper, a search
engine, a markdown formatter ... you get the idea) and collaborate with each other (maybe 
one agent is waiting for another agent's analysis or two agents need to discuss a topic
from different points of views) to show the user the final output.

Easy, right? At least the high level description üòÇ

Now that you know the basics of CrewAI, let me detail the "problem" I wanted to solve in this
article (although it is pretty clear from the title).

What if we ask CrewAI to settle, once and for all, which IDE is better for Python programming: PyCharm or VS Code?

Let's reframe this problem into CrewAI!


## Agents ü§ñ

As I told you before, one of the core concepts in CrewAI is the concept of Agent. For this
application, I've defined 3 different agents.

### PyCharm Agent

Our first agent has one clear goal: **conducting a thorough research on why PyCharm is a better
IDE than VS Code**

As you can see below, it's very easy to define an Agent in CrewAI. We just need to provide
a **role**, a **goal** , a **list of tools** the agent can use (more on this later) and a **backstory**.

We can also set the `verbose` to `True` if you want to follow the agentic flow.

```python
def pycharm_agent():
    return Agent(
        role="PyCharm Python Programmer",
        goal="Conduct thorough research on why PyCharm is a BETTER IDE than VSCode for Python development",
        tools=TOOLS,
        backstory=dedent("""
        As a Python developer deeply enamored with the PyCharm IDE, you cherish its interface, debugging 
        capabilities, and the seamless integration of features like the terminal. It frustrates you when
        fellow programmers assert that VSCode surpasses PyCharm. Your mission is to persuade the Python
        IDE judge of PyCharm's superiority over VSCode.
        """),
        verbose=True,
        allow_delegation=False
    )
```

### VS Code Agent

Let's follow the same approach as before, but for the VS Code Agent.

```python
def vscode_agent():
    return Agent(
        role="VSCode Python Programmer",
        goal="Conduct thorough research on why VScode is a BETTER IDE than PyCharm for Python development",
        tools=TOOLS,
        backstory=dedent("""
        As a devoted VSCode programmer, you find its versatility, customizability, and extensive extension library
        irresistible. You feel a pang of exasperation when others claim that PyCharm reigns supreme. Your mission
        is to persuade the Python IDE judge of VSCode's superiority over PyCharm.
        """),
        verbose=True,
        allow_delegation=False,
    )
```

### IDE Judge Agent

Finally, I've created an agent that'll act as the judge in this discussion. Given the
research made by both the PyCharm and VS Code agents, this agent will be in charge of
giving a final verdict to the never ending debate! ü§£

```python
def ide_judge_agent():
    return Agent(
        role="Python IDE judge",
        goal="Compile all gathered information about pros and cons of both PyCharm and VSCode into a concise,"
             "informative briefing document. You need to provide the final answer on which IDE is better for Python"
             ": VSCode or PyCharm?",
        tools=TOOLS,
        backstory="As the Python IDE Judge your role is to be impartial in your final decision about which"
                  " IDE is better for Python development: PyCharm or VSCode?",
        verbose=True
    )
```

Ok, so we have the agents ready to go! It's time to show you how to create a custom tool
in CrewAI üõ†Ô∏è

# Tools üõ†Ô∏è

For this application, I didn't need anything fancy, just a way to search for content related
to PyCharm / VS Code on the web. In fact, I simply reused one of the [CrewAI Examples](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI-examples/blob/main/prep-for-a-meeting/tools/ExaSearchTool.py),
but update the code to using CrewAI tools instead of Langchain tools. 

```python
import os
from exa_py import Exa
from crewai_tools import tool
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

EXA = Exa(api_key=os.environ["EXA_API_KEY"])


@tool
def search(query: str):
	"""Search for a webpage based on the provided query"""
	return EXA.search(f"{query}", use_autoprompt=True, num_results=3)


@tool
def find_similar(url: str):
	"""Search for webpages similar to a given URL.
	The url passed in should be a URL returned from `search`.
	"""
	return EXA.find_similar(url, num_results=10)


@tool
def get_contents(ids: list):
	"""Get the contents of a webpage.
	The ids must be passed in as a list, a list of ids returned from `search`.
	"""
	contents = str(EXA.get_contents(ids))
	contents = contents.split("URL:")
	contents = [content[:1000] for content in contents]
	return "\n\n".join(contents)


TOOLS = [search, find_similar, get_contents]
```

As you can see in the code above, we are defining three tools (indicated by the `@tool` decorator) 
, all of them related with the [Exa search engine](https://exa.ai/search?c=all). By using these tools,
the agents will be able to look for promising information about PyCharm / VS Code using Exa search. 

There's only one thing left ... the tasks!


## Tasks üèóÔ∏è

Task definition is also very easy in CrewAI. To define a task we only need to provide a 
**description**, the **expected output** and finally the **agent** (remember the diagram at
the beginning, an agent is responsible for a task).

I've defined three tasks for this use case (as you can see, they are pretty straightforward)

```python
from textwrap import dedent
from crewai import Task


class VSCodeVSPyCharmTasks:
    @staticmethod
    def pycharm_research_task(agent):
        return Task(
            description=dedent("""
            Conduct a comprehensive research on the advantages of PyCharm over VSCode for Python development
            """),
            expected_output=dedent("""
            A detailed report on why PyCharm is a better Python IDE than VSCode and all the 
            disadvantages of using VSCode for Python development.
            """),
            agent=agent
        )

    @staticmethod
    def vscode_research_task(agent):
        return Task(
            description=dedent("""
            Conduct a comprehensive research on the advantages of VSCode over PyCharm for Python development
            """),
            expected_output=dedent("""
            A detailed report on why VSCode is a better Python IDE than PyCharm and all the 
            disadvantages of using PyCharm for Python development.
            """),
            agent=agent
        )

    @staticmethod
    def final_verdict_task(agent):
        return Task(
            description=dedent("""
            Gather all the information provided about the advantages and disadvantages of both PyCharm and VSCode,
            analyse it and summarise it into an informative briefing document. Give a final verdict on which
            IDE is better for Python development based on all the provided information.
            """),
            expected_output=dedent("""
            A summary of the advantages and disadvantages of both PyCharm and VSCode and a final verdict on
            which one is better for Python development.
            """),
            agent=agent
        )

```

We are almost there! During the article we have defined our agents, our tasks and our tools, so ...
what's left? ü§î

Well, we need to create the crew, that is, making all the different parts work together!

Let's import each one of the objects we've been creating and let's connect them together
using the `Crew` object. Then, simply `kickoff` the application!!

```python
from crewai import Crew

from tasks import VSCodeVSPyCharmTasks
from agents import VSCodeVSPyCharmAgents

tasks = VSCodeVSPyCharmTasks()
agents = VSCodeVSPyCharmAgents()

pycharm_agent = agents.pycharm_agent()
vscode_agent = agents.vscode_agent()
ide_judge_agent = agents.ide_judge_agent()

pycharm_research_task = tasks.pycharm_research_task(pycharm_agent)
vscode_research_task = tasks.vscode_research_task(vscode_agent)
final_verdict_task = tasks.final_verdict_task(ide_judge_agent)

final_verdict_task.context = [pycharm_research_task, vscode_research_task]

crew = Crew(
    agents=[
        pycharm_agent,
        vscode_agent,
        ide_judge_agent
    ],
    tasks=[
        pycharm_research_task,
        vscode_research_task,
        final_verdict_task
    ]
)

result = crew.kickoff()
```

## Final Verdict? ‚öñÔ∏è

Let's reveal the final verdict then (SPOILER ALERT üö®), which IDE is better according to CrewAI?
Well, sorry to disappoint you reader, but CrewAI's final response is as disappointing as it is 
extremely reasonable:
